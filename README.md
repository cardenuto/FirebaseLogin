#Branch - Example-UserInfo
This branch is the NewActivity example plus the saving of user data into the database under the users node. It also adds scrolling to the adjusted login screen (fragment_firebase_login.xml) along with a reset password button. The creates the need for a change password button,  this was added to future development. I am not sure it will be part of this project.

# FirebaseLogin
This repository provides reusable code that can be included in your Android project to add Firebase login functionality. It utilizes the FirebaseUI library (version 0.3.1), encapsulating it into its own activity, to be started when needed. It expands the login functionality by overriding the delivered login layout (fragment_firebase_login.xml) adding multi-language support by implementing resource strings and the ability to create/register a new user.  

It is delivered in the form of examples with setup instructions included on the master branch.
