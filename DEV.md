#FirebaseLogin Development

##Current 
- create a separate application user id AUID (use in place of the UID when processing user IDs).  This will give the ability to change login authentication and not have to update much data, it will also allow for multiple emails to update the save application user information.

##Future
- Setting up a presence system
- Save the last login method used, and email address used if Password Auth, and update the login screen
- Check time length of the login â€“ limit need to re-login on android 
- Add Material Design to dialogs
- Check for email already registered with another auth provider
- Ability to change password
